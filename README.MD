# Advanced React - Meta Certification ⚛️

This repository documents my progress and practical projects from the **Advanced React** course, part of the **Meta Professional Certification** (via Coursera).

## 🎯 Professional Goal
As a Frontend Developer with over 5 years of experience, the purpose of this course is to standardize and validate advanced knowledge in the React ecosystem.

## 📚 Syllabus and Learning Milestones

### Module 1: Components
In this introductory module, you will learn about React and its professional opportunities. You will also learn to set up your coding environment for the most productive learning experience possible. The purpose of this module is to understand the *what* and *why* behind learning React.

**Key Learnings:**
- Summarize React and different professional paths.
- Render and transform lists with keys in React.
- Distinguish between controlled and uncontrolled React components.
- Create a controlled form component in React.
- Share component state by lifting state up to the nearest common ancestor.
- Share global state using React Context.

### Module 2: React Hooks and Custom Hooks
The second module covers React hooks and custom hooks. You will learn to use all common hooks in React and how to implement them in your application. You will also test your skills by building your own custom hooks.

**Key Learnings:**
- Explain the uses and purpose of React hooks.
- Detail the concept and nature of state and state changes.
- Use the **State hook** to declare, read, and update component state.
- Use the **Effect hook** to perform side effects within a React component.
- Use hooks for *data fetching* in React.
- Create appropriate **custom hooks** in React.

### Module 3: JSX and Testing
In this module, you will learn about JSX and testing in React. You will cover JSX in depth and discover advanced patterns for encapsulating common behaviors through Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props. Then, you will learn to use Jest and React Testing Library to write and run tests in your applications.

**Key Learnings:**
- Define types of children within JSX.
- Describe the process and purpose of creating **Render Props**.
- Describe the process and purpose of creating **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**.
- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to write and run tests in your applications.

### Module 4: Graded Assessment
In this module, you will be assessed on key skills covered in the course and create a project to add to your portfolio. This is a creative project where the goal is to use as many React concepts as possible.

**Key Learnings:**
- Synthesize skills from this course to create a portfolio.
- Reflect on course content and the learning path ahead.
