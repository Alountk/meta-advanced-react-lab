# Advanced React - Meta Certification ⚛️

This repository documents my progress and practical projects from the **Advanced React** course, part of the **Meta Professional Certification** (via Coursera).

## 🎯 Professional Goal
As a Frontend Developer with over 5 years of experience, the purpose of this course is to standardize and validate advanced knowledge in the React ecosystem, focusing on:
- **Design Patterns:** Component composition, HOCs (Higher-Order Components), and Render Props.
- **Performance:** Render optimization and advanced state management.
- **Software Quality:** Deep dive into Unit Testing and Integration Testing.

## 📚 Syllabus and Learning Milestones
The course focuses on key concepts that I apply in large-scale project architectures:

1.  **Advanced Components:**
    - Use of **Advanced Hooks** (`useReducer`, `useRef`, `useContext`).
    - Creation of **Custom Hooks** for reusable business logic.
    - Composition patterns to avoid *prop drilling*.

2.  **Forms and Lists Management:**
    - Controlled vs. uncontrolled components.
    - Rendering optimization in massive lists.

3.  **Integration and APIs:**
    - *Data fetching* patterns and side effect handling (`useEffect`).

4.  **Testing (Jest & React Testing Library):**
    - Testing strategies for complex components.
    - Simulation of user events and asynchrony.
